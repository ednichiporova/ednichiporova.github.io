Система контроля версий — это система, записывающая изменения в файл или набор файлов в течение времени и позволяющая вернуться позже к определённой версии. Для контроля версий файлов в этой книге в качестве примера будет использоваться исходный код программного обеспечения, хотя на самом деле вы можете использовать контроль версий практически для любых типов файлов.\n  Многие люди в качестве метода контроля версий применяют копирование файлов в отдельный каталог (возможно даже, каталог с отметкой по времени, если они достаточно сообразительны). Данный подход очень распространён из-за его простоты, однако он невероятно сильно подвержен появлению ошибок. Можно легко забыть в каком каталоге вы находитесь и случайно изменить не тот файл или скопировать не те файлы, которые вы хотели.Для того, чтобы решить эту проблему, программисты давным-давно разработали локальные СКВ с простой базой данных, которая хранит записи о всех изменениях в файлах, осуществляя тем самым контроль ревизий.\n  Следующая серьёзная проблема, с которой сталкиваются люди, — это необходимость взаимодействовать с другими разработчиками. Для того, чтобы разобраться с ней, были разработаны централизованные системы контроля версий (ЦСКВ). Такие системы, как CVS, Subversion и Perforce, используют единственный сервер, содержащий все версии файлов, и некоторое количество клиентов, которые получают файлы из этого централизованного хранилища. Применение ЦСКВ являлось стандартом на протяжении многих лет.\n    The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.
